_OCTOBER 28, 2023_

As part of NEAR&apos;s ongoing efforts to improve its infrastructure, they are transitioning from explorer.near.org to the Explorer Selector by the end of November 2023. Public access to Explorer DB will be turned off on November 30, 2023, and the Legacy NEAR Explorer will be turned off on January 31, 2024. NEARBlocks.io block explorer will continue to be actively maintained throughout this transition.

Due to this migration, NEAR coin data will be temporarily unavailable in Cypherock. This means that you will not be able to perform “certain” operations on the NEAR blockchain using Cypherock, such as creating custom accounts, viewing transactions. **You can still send or receive NEAR.**

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We are working closely with NEAR to ensure that NEAR coin data is available again as soon as possible.

In the meantime, you can still use Cypherock for other coins and tokens, and check your near account transactions on <https://nearblocks.io/>

Thank you for your understanding.
